Or with my full name: One Password For Every Site. That is my name and that is what you will be able to do.
No more need for remembering lots of userid's and storing passwords in separate documents or tools. Only one, easy to
remember and easy to type password, and I will take care of the rest. You will be logging in with extreme strong passwords,
your password will be different on every site and your password will not get stored anywhere making it the most secure way.
