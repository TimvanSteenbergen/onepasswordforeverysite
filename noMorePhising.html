<p>Even when you are suffering a homograph attack, meaning visiting https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ will show
    www.apple.com in the url-bar, I will keep you safe. I will correctly give you the password belonging to
    https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ thus they will not get your password for your account on www.apple.com!
