<h2>I am very easy to use.</h2>
<p>I will make it as easy as possible for you to log anywhere. It is enough to remember only one password and
    I will keep track of your user-id's.</p>
<p>Although using one password is relatively safe, you can be even safer if you use a different password per site.
    I would advise to do so, but that is up to you.</p>
