<h2>The safest password helper</h2>
<p>Why is my way of password-assistance far safer, and better in keeping your data safe compared to other
    password-helpers and browser-functions?</p>
<dl>
    <dt>First: No password storage.</dt>
    <dd> I do not store any of your passwords anywhere. I don’t need to. All I store is your user-id's per domain.
        Other password-helpers require you to trust them with a list of your user-id-and-password combinations. Although
        they try to keep it safe by encrypting that datafile, that file can always get hacked or legally opened by
        some three-letter governmental institution, or used against your intention by the
        password-helper’s company. Do you trust all of them?
    </dd>
    <dt>Second: I am Open Source.</dt>
    <dd>Most password-helpers are not open-source but proprietary, meaning they do not give you the
        opportunity to look at the code. So, you have no way to tell what they actually do with the data you
        provided them.
    </dd>
    <dt>Third: I send nothing at all over the internet.</dt>
    <dd>The little data that you provide me, I will keep that confided to your computer/tablet/phone. I never
        ever send any of your data across the internet. Most password-helpers do. They even like to store your
        data in 'The Cloud'. Do you trust the cloud?
    </dd>
    <dt>Fourth: You get Very-Strong-Passwords</dt>
    <dd>All your passwords will have the maximum strength available. A mix of up to 120 characters of
        lowercase,
        uppercase, numbers and special characters. Always at least one of each.
    </dd>
    <dt>Fifth: All code is simple and readable</dt>
    <dd>I kept my software as simple and readable as possible so even novice programmers will be able to understand
        the code entirely.
    </dd>
    <dt>Sixth: Phishing gets harder</dt>
    <dd>Because the password changes as soon as the domainname changes, malicious phishing criminals will receive a
        different password then you actually use.
    </dd>
