<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When you enter any webpage, I check if the page contains a password field.</li>
    <li>If so, I will recall the user-id from your previous login and prefill your user-id.</li>
    <li>You enter your single password and click on the Opfes-login-button.</li>
    <li>I will generate your password, based on the password you provided, together with the domain name and some
        other values. This is why I do not store any password. I just regenerate the psasword you need every time
        you provide me your password.
    </li>
    <li>I will prefill the generated password and login.</li>
</ul>
